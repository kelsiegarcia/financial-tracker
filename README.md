# Web Pages

Built using React, it's a single interactive page.
There are two buttons to choose between transaction types. The CSS dynamically displays what transaction type is selected. The input field allows users to enter a numerical amount they wish to withdraw or deposit. Depending on what transaction they choose the amount will be either added or subtracted and will dynamically render the remaining total. After successful transaction the input clears and is ready for the next transaction. The app will alert users of invalid input or insufficient funds.
